<H1>Travel site Project</HI>

<H3>One of my challenges from the Simplon school of nerds
</H3>

A travel agency wants to build its new website. It wants an admin interface to manage its trips, users and visitor contact via the site form.
As it plans to release a mobile application at a later date, part of the site needs to be designed to be connectable via API.

<H3>Instructions for use</H3>

- git clone git@github.com:Justineleq/BriefTravelSite.git 
- cd travel_frontend_next
- npm run dev

  http://localhost:3000/

- cd travel_backend_symfony
- symfony console server:start -d

  http://localhost:8000/

  <H3>With a little help from...</H3>
